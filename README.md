# RDF::AggregateRepo

An aggregate RDF::Dataset supporting a subset of named graphs and zero or more named graphs mapped to the default graph.

## Description

Maps named graphs from one or more `RDF::Queryable` instances into a single dataset, allowing a specific set of _named graphs_ to be seen, as well as a _default graph_ made up from one or more _named graphs_. This is used to implement [RDF Datasets][].

## Examples

    require 'rdf'
    require 'rdf/nquads'
    repo = RDF::Repository.load("http://ruby-rdf.github.com/rdf/etc/doap.nq")
    
    # Instantiate a new aggregate repo based on an existing repo
    aggregate = RDF::AggregateRepo.new(repo)
    
    # Use the default graph from the repo as the default graph of the aggregate
    aggregate.add_default(false)
    
    # Use a single named graph
    aggregate.add_named(RDF::URI("http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me"))

    # Retrieve all contexts
    aggreggate.contexts.to_a #=> [RDF::URI("http://greggkellogg.net/foaf#me")]

## Contributing
This repository uses [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) to mange development and release activity. All submissions _must_ be on a feature branch based on the _develop_ branch to ease staging and integration.

* Do your best to adhere to the existing coding conventions and idioms.
* Don't use hard tabs, and don't leave trailing whitespace on any line.
  Before committing, run `git diff --check` to make sure of this.
* Do document every method you add using [YARD][] annotations. Read the
  [tutorial][YARD-GS] or just look at the existing code for examples.
* Don't touch the `.gemspec` or `VERSION` files. If you need to change them,
  do so on your private branch only.
* Do feel free to add yourself to the `CREDITS` file and the
  corresponding list in the the `README`. Alphabetical order applies.
* Don't touch the `AUTHORS` file. If your contributions are significant
  enough, be assured we will eventually add you in there.
* Do note that in order for us to merge any non-trivial changes (as a rule
  of thumb, additions larger than about 15 lines of code), we need an
  explicit [public domain dedication][PDD] on record from you.
